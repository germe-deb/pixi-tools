# Pixi tools

### my personal collection of scripts for my TCL E400

there's probably nothing of interest here.

I made a script to install apps through adb using super user permissions, because I somehow lost the ability to use `adb install package.apk`.

it's pixi-install.fish.

if you want you can see the code and use it for your own device, it's not like it's much actually.
